## Sidenote: the names can be confusing...

📺 [Here's a great 10 minute video about Microsoft Copilot personal and work experiences](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6yiyXRNCJY)

* **GPT / Large Language Models (LLMs)** = the AI models. OpenAI is the organisation that built them. They are AI models so don't have a user interface. People can build user interfaces to interact with these models - chat is one way, but it doesn't have to be QnA or interactive with users.
* [**ChatGPT**](https://chat.openai.com/) = a chat application OpenAI built so that you can interact with the underlying model(s). The free version interacts directly with the model, so what it "knows" is effectively how the human language works, based on the vast volume of data the model has been trained on. It doesn't actually know any facts - think auto-complete on speed.
* [**Copilot** in web (fka Bing Chat)](https://copilot.microsoft.com/) = another user interface, also chat based. Built by Microsoft. In addition to having the "knowledge" of the AI models, it also has access to search the internet for "facts", and uses it's knowledge of the human language to respond to you in natural language. Think ChatGPT+Bing search.
* **Copilot** app = basically Copilot in web, but as a mobile app.
* [**Copilot** on the Edge sidebar](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge/features/copilot?form=MA13FJ) = Copilot in web, but it works on the side instead of taking over your screen as _the_ webpage. This means it sits side-by-side with the current webpage you have open and can access information on that webpage (if you allow it). Makes it easier to do things like ask it to summarise the page/PDF you have open, or draft up something and add it to the Facebook/LinkedIn/Google doc you have open.
* [**Copilot** in Windows](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/) = Copilot in the sidebar of Windows instead of Edge. Means it can do "computer stuff", where Copilot in Edge does "web stuff". Copilot in Windows can change display resolution, edit Windows settings, etc.
* **Copilot** in M365 apps = this isn't the exact product name, but included for completeness. Basically similar sidebar concept, but in Word, Outlook, Excel, etc. Where it's an AI agent that can help you do stuff. See below

### The following are currently licensed

* [Copilot Pro](https://www.microsoft.com/en-nz/store/b/copilotpro) = the pro version for Copilot. Designed for individuals. Allows access to Copilot in M365 apps in addition to the web, app, Edge, and Windows.
* M365 Copilot = for organisations. Same Copilot concepts, but with more features for businesses like Security, enterprise applications, etc. An entire article to cover this world, so won't include more here, but if you want to look into it [this blog](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/2024/01/15/expanding-copilot-for-microsoft-365-to-businesses-of-all-sizes/) is a good start.
